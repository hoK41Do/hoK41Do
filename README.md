- 👋 Hi, I’m @hoK41Do 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages and how to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, java script and python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well I am kinda new to coding, so I think I am no help (yet).
- 📫 How to reach me ... That's a good question, since I am "social media shy". Maybe you can contact me here. =)
